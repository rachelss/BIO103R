## Goals for Lab 1

* Import data into **R**
* Save data in **R** as variables
* Plot diversity data as a scatterplot and a boxplot
* Plot certain parts of your data

<br>

## 1. Getting Started

You will be using **R** for data analysis this semester. **R** is a versatile, free data handling software widely-used by scientists. **R** is great for organizing data, analyzing data, and presenting data. 

Here is some basic vocabulary you will need when using **R**.

* **R script:** the lines of code that you are writing (filename.R)
* **R project:** your **R** script, any variables you have created, and your current R environment (filename.Rproj)
* **Variable:** a way to store your data for use in the **R** script. For example, if you type x=3 into **R**, then **R** now stores x (the variable) as the number 3.
* **Package:** a set of functions/codes that you can load into your script (examples - gsheet, ggplot2)
* **Function:** an action or calculation that you perform on your variables (examples - gsheet2tbl, subset, mean, library)
* **Comment:** does not run as code, starts with #. You use comments to keep track of what your code is doing

<br>

More information on **R** is at [http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#why_learn_r](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html#why_learn_r).


### Helpful Hints

*	Uppercase/lowercase matters!
*	Spaces and empty lines do not matter in your code
*	Do not use spaces in your variable names or file names (use _ or - or . )
*	Links to GoogleSheets need to be in 'single quotes'
*	`#`Comment your code so you know what's going on
*	Store variables using `<-`
*	Access the datapoints in a `variable` using `variable[]`

##### Page Break

Creating a new project and script will give you four windows in **R**: 

* **R script:** where you type your comments and code, and save your work
*	**R environment:** where all your variables show up and are organized
*	**R console:** where the code runs and the text output shows. Errors show here too!
*	**Graphical output:** where your graphs will show.

## 2. How to get your data into R

Last week you calculated the Simpson diversity index for the plankton samples at each of four site types (GSO outgoing, GSO incoming, FOX outgoing, and FOX incoming). 

A diversity index allows you to understand the variation in diversity among site types. The following lines of code will import your data (the class data about the diversity of each plot) directly into **R** from Google Sheets.

<br>

### 2a. Load the packages you need

The tools you need are found in "packages". Packages are like books from the library: pre-written bundles of code that can perform the tasks we want. They contain functions and commands to perform analyses. Here, we will load the `gsheet` package. 

Type the code (from the grey boxes) into the SCRIPT window of RStudio (top left). With your cursor on the line of code, click Run (top right of the SCRIPT window in RStudio). The line of code will show up in the R console window once it is run (bottom left). 

<br>


```{r lib}
library(gsheet)
```

![](runR.png) 

##### Page Break


### 2b. Tell R where your data is

Assign the link to your diversity data to the variable "`url`". 

You store a number or word or data to a variable using `<-`.

The variable name goes on the left of the arrow and the information goes on the right. Use the link for your section found on the homepage of the BIO104 Sakai site.

<br>

Replace the link with yours in this command. Make sure you put it in 'single quotes'!
```{r load}
url <- 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTQPw3GsqID_ay6YqdNISOOKIMb9HHeBpFu7EWFiGj8'
```
Remember to click Run with your cursor on the line of code.
Once you have Run this command, make sure your new variable shows up in the R environment window (top right).

![](runurl.png)

<br>

### 2c. Load the data and store it as a variable

Load the data from the spreadsheet (now stored as variable `url`). Use the function `gsheet2tbl` to get the data from the website for use in **R**. This function is from the `gsheets` package. Store the data as variable `diversitydata`.

```{r gsheet}
diversitydata <- gsheet2tbl(url)
```


* The line was run correctly if you get the prompt (`>`) in the R console window (bottom left)
*	Make sure the `diversitydata` variable shows up in the R environment (top right)


##### Page Break


### 2d. Explore your data

Click on the `diversitydata` variable in the R environment. The data stored in `diversitydata` will appear in the R script window (top left). It should look just like your spreadsheet data! 

<br>

![](exploredata.png)


Click next to the `>` in the R console. 

* Type **`diversitydata[1]`** into the R console and hit the Enter button on your keyboard. This is the first column of the data stored in `diversitydata`.
*	Type **`diversitydata[2]`** into the R console and hit the Enter button on your keyboard. This is the second column of the data stored in `diversitydata`.

<br>

You may have noticed that R stored `diversitydata` as a table! Try accessing any datapoint in the table by typing:

*	`diversitydata[row, column]`
* For example: **`diversitydata[2,3]`**

<br>

What happens if you try to access a column that isn't in the variable `diversitydata`?

* For example: **`diversitydata[2,7]`**

You get an error! Errors are fine - they tell when something is not right in your code. Read the error and then try to fix it. There are only 3 columns in `diversitydata` and your command tried to access column 7.

##### Page Break


## 3. Keep track of what your commands do

As you work, you are typing commands that you probably won't remember next week. **Use the `#` symbol to explain your lines of code.** Anything that you type after the `#` will not run in your code. 

<br>

```{r gsheet2, eval=FALSE}
#load the package that allows us to access google sheets 
library(gsheet)

#assign the website address for the data to a variable using an arrow <-
# "variable" <- 'website address for data'
url <- 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTQPw3GsqID_ay6YqdNISOOKIMb9HHeBpFu7EWFiGj8'

#load the data from google sheets and store it as the variable diversitydata
# "variable" <- "command to work on"(variable from last line)
diversitydata <- gsheet2tbl(url)
```

**Use the # symbol to add comments to your script as you enter the commands below**

<br>

<br>

**SAVE your work**. Save your code by clicking `File > Save`.

**Name your file Lab1_YourName.R.** 
Remember to put ".R" at the end! Your work will save to the server that we are using for this lab. You will be able to access your work on this server from other computers, as long as you know the web address, your username and password.

## 4. Plot your data

### 4a. Load the plotting library

```{r loadlibrary}
# Load the package that allows us to plot data

library(ggplot2)
```

Make sure you click Run after typing in each line of code.

<br>

### 4b. Create the base layer of your plot 

Use the command `ggplot`:

*	`diversitydata` is the name of the variable containing your data
*	`aes` tells `ggplot` what the plot will look like ("aesthetics") including the x and y variables
*	`SiteType` is the column name from the data table describing the site locations and is the column of data you want to plot on the x-axis.
*	`Diversity` is the column name from the data table listing the Simpson Diversity index values and is the name of the column of data you want to plot on the y-axis.

<br>

Run this ggplot command. 

The graph will show up in the Graphical Output window (bottom right).

<br>

```{r makeplot, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
# Create a plot

ggplot(diversitydata, aes(x=SiteType,y=Diversity))
```


##### Page Break


### 4c. Add data points to your plot

Use the `geom_point()` command to add points to your plot.

*	Put a `+` between the `ggplot` command and `geom_point()`

<br>

```{r points, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
# Add points to the plot using geom_point()

ggplot(diversitydata, aes(x=SiteType,y=Diversity)) + geom_point()
```


<br>


### 4d. Add a boxplot on top of your plot

* A boxplot summarizes your data by plotting:

    + the median (middle) value as a horizontal line
    + 50% of the data within the box
    + the remaining top and bottom  25% of the data as lines above and below the box. A boxplot based on the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 and 5 would have the median line located at 3.5 (the median), the upper part of the box at 4 and the lower part of the box at 3.


* **The greater the range of the boxplot, the greater the variation of your data!**
  
* Add a boxplot using the `geom_boxplot()` command
* Put a `+` between the `geom_point()` command and `geom_boxplot()`
* The `+` must come at the end of a line or the command will end and not plot the layer

##### Page Break


```{r plotbox}
# Add boxplots to the plot using geom_boxplot()

ggplot(diversitydata, aes(x=SiteType,y=Diversity))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_boxplot()
```

<br>

<br>

**Remember to add descriptive comments to your script!**

Note: the order of the plotting instructions tells **R** to make:

1.	The base plot
2.	The data points
3.	The boxplots on top of the data points


##### Page Break



## 5. Edit your boxplots


### 5a. Add axis labels to your plot

The variable `Diversity` is an integer (a numerical value), which means it is on a continuous scale; thus, the function to label your y axis is continuous (`scale_y_continuous`). Other examples of continuous variables are time, weight, or date since they are numerical integers. We use a discrete scale when plotting variables like `Location` or `Tide` or `Color`, where each variable is its own category (`scale_x_discrete`).

* Use the `scale_x_discrete()` function and the `name =` function to label your x-axis "Conditions at site". 

<br>

```{r xlabel}
# Plot just the boxplots and change the x-axis label

ggplot(diversitydata, aes(x=SiteType,y=Diversity))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_x_discrete(name ="Conditions at site")
```


##### Page Break


* Use the `scale_y_continuous()` function to label your y-axis correctly.

<br>

```{r ylabel}
# Plot just the boxplots and change the x-axis and y-axis labels

ggplot(diversitydata, aes(x=SiteType,y=Diversity))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_x_discrete(name ="Conditions at site") +
  scale_y_continuous(name="Simpson Diversity Index")
```

<br>

### 5b. Save your boxplot as an image

* Click on Plots > Export > Save as Image...
* Name your file (Lab1_Boxplot1) and click Save.
* To view your saved images, go to File > Open Files, then click on the image you want. Open the image to copy/paste it into your lab report (written in Word or GoogleDocs).


##### Page Break



### 5c. Look at a subset of data

If you want to only show data from the two FOX Island sites, then make a new variable containing just these data by filtering your larger dataset.

First load the `dplyr` library, which contains a filtering function.

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE }
# Load the dplyr library

library(dplyr)
```

<br>

Then `filter` the data to include SiteTypes FOX_outgoing and FOX_incoming (the vertical bar means "and")

```{r filter, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Create a new variable named FOXonly with just the FOX_incoming and FOX_outgoing data

FOXonly <- filter(diversitydata,SiteType=="FOX_incoming" | SiteType=="FOX_outgoing")
```

<br>

Now plot this new dataset using boxplots.

```{r , fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
# Plot the FOXonly data with boxplots and changed axis labels

ggplot(FOXonly, aes(x=SiteType, y=Diversity)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_x_discrete(name ="Conditions at site")+
  scale_y_continuous(name="Simpson Diversity Index")
```

**Turn in this final boxplot of the data in your lab report.**

**(Plots > Export > Save as Image... > Name your file)**

## 6. Homework Assignment

### Part 1. Graphing incoming vs. outgoing diversity at the GSO sites

1. Subset your diversity data for just the GSO sites. Make a boxplot like you did in Step 5d.
Hint: create a new variable named `GSOonly`
2. Turn in your boxplots from both sites.
3. Write a summary to compare the incoming and outgoing sites at both locations. Which has a higher diversity? Please explain why one tide may have a higher diversity index value than the other. (2-3 sentences)
4. Which has a greater amount of variation in the data? How can you tell?
5. Include your summary table of your data formatted according to the lecture and poster in the BIO 104 lab.

### Part 2. Graphing Long-Term Plankton Data

The samples you worked with in class are part of one of the world's oldest datasets of regularly collected plankton samples. These samples have been collected weekly since 1999 at the Fox Island Station in Narragansett Bay, near Wickford. More information on this weekly plankton survery can be found at https://web.uri.edu/plankton/data/.

In class, you calculated the diversity values of two of these samples from January 2018 at the Fox Island Station, in addition to the two samples collected from the GSO location. Even though many groups in your class calculated the diversity values of these two samples, each calculated diversity value represents one estimate for these two samples. To more thoroughly and accurately examine plankton diversity at the Fox Island station, you will analyze diversity data from this long-term dataset collected every week since 1999.

1. Make a boxplot comparing plankton diversity during incoming and outgoing tides at the Fox Island Site from all months in the long-term dataset, like you did in Step 4 (Hint: `x=Tide`).
2. Data are available at  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RdEzJqLi1vRcpR80nH__0n7nJJ8gPZxoxxuHQqvtbWs/
3. Start with the commands: 
```{r newdataload, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
url2 <-'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ 1RdEzJqLi1vRcpR80nH__0n7nJJ8gPZxoxxuHQqvtbWs/'
FOXyearlydiversitydata <- gsheet2tbl(url2)
```

4. Select three months and make a diversity index boxplot comparing just those 3 months, like you did in Step 5d and Homework Part 1. Hint: create a new variable named `threemonthsonly` and plot using `x=Month`

6. Write a summary describing differences in diversity between tides and months at the Fox Island site (2-3 sentences). Make sure to discuss which of the months that you chose had the most variation (boxplot range) in diversity and highest median diversity value.
